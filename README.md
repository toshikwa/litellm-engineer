> This repository is a fork of [Bedrock Engineer](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-engineer) with the purpose of adding LiteLLM support. Currently, only Amazon Bedrock is supported as a backend of LiteLLM. Mac users can download the application [here](https://github.com/toshikwa/litellm-engineer/releases/latest/download/bedrock-engineer-1.8.1-litellm.4.dmg).

# üßô Bedrock Engineer (with LiteLLM)

Bedrock Engineer is Autonomous software development agent apps using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), capable of customize to create/edit files, execute commands, search the web, use knowledge base, use multi-agents, generative images and more.

## üíª Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/788583b6-148b-4e9d-9015-c24ad4be6162

## üçé Getting Started

Bedrock Engineer is a native app, you can download the app or build the source code to use it.

### Download

MacOS:

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Download_FOR_MAC-Latest%20Release-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple" alt="Download Latest Release" height="40">](https://github.com/toshikwa/litellm-engineer/releases/latest/download/bedrock-engineer-1.8.1-litellm.4.dmg)

It is optimized for MacOS, but can also be built and used on Windows and Linux OS. If you have any problems, please report an issue.

<details>
<summary>Tips for Installation</summary>

### Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Open the DMG file and drag the app to your Applications folder
3. Launch the app and configure your AWS credentials
4. Open System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then put a checkmark to "Allow apps downloaded from anywhere" -> Click OK and enter your password

### Opening the Application

If you see "'Bedrock Engineer' can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software":

1. Open System Preferences
2. Click Privacy & Security
3. Scroll down and click "Open Anyway" next to "Bedrock Engineer was blocked to protect your Mac."

If a configuration file error occurs when starting the application, please check the following configuration files. If you cannot start the application even after deleting the configuration files and restarting it, please file an issue.

</details>

### Build

First, install the npm modules:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run build:mac
```

or

```
npm run build:win
```

or

```
npm run build:linux
```

## Agent Chat

The autonomous AI agent capable of development assists your development process. It provides functionality similar to AI assistants like [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), but with its own UI that doesn't depend on editors like VS Code. This enables richer diagramming and interactive experiences in Bedrock Engineer's agent chat feature. Additionally, with agent customization capabilities, you can utilize agents for use cases beyond development.

- üí¨ Interactive chat interface with human-like Amazon Nova, Claude, and Meta llama models
- üìÅ File system operations (create folders, files, read/write files)
- üîç Web search capabilities using Tavily API
- üèóÔ∏è Project structure creation and management
- üßê Code analysis and improvement suggestions

## Website Generator

Generate and preview website source code in real-time. Currently supports the following libraries, and you can interactively generate code by providing additional instructions:

- React.js (w/ Typescript)
- Vue.js (w/ Typescript)
- Svelte.js
- Vanilla.js

Here are examples of screens generated by the Website Generator:

| ![website-gen](./assets/website-generator.png) | ![website-gen-data](./assets/website-generator-data-visualization.png) | ![website-gen-healthcare](./assets/website-generator-healthcare.png) |
| :--------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|          House Plant E-commerce Site           |                           Data Visualization                           |                           Healthcare Blog                            |

The following styles are also supported as presets:

- Inline styling
- Tailwind.css
- Material UI (React mode only)

### Agentic-RAG (Connect to Design System Data Source)

By connecting to Amazon Bedrock's Knowledge Base, you can generate websites referencing any design system, project source code, or website styles.

You need to store source code and crawled web pages in the knowledge base in advance. When registering source code in the knowledge base, it is recommended to convert it into a format that LLM can easily understand using methods such as [gpt-repository-loader](https://github.com/mpoon/gpt-repository-loader). Figma design files can be referenced by registering HTML and CSS exported versions to the Knowledge Base.

Click the "Connect" button at the bottom of the screen and enter your knowledge base ID.

### Web Search Agent

Website Generator integrates a code generation agent that utilizes web search capabilities. This feature allows you to generate more sophisticated websites by referencing the latest library information, design trends, and coding best practices. To use the search functionality, click the "Search" button at the bottom of the screen to enable it.

## Step Functions Generator

Generate AWS Step Functions ASL definitions and preview them in real-time.

![step-functions-generator](./assets/step-functions-generator.png)

## Diagram Generator

Create AWS architecture diagrams with ease using natural language descriptions. The Diagram Generator leverages Amazon Bedrock's powerful language models to convert your text descriptions into professional AWS architecture diagrams.

Key features:

- üèóÔ∏è Generate AWS architecture diagrams from natural language descriptions
- üîç Web search integration to gather up-to-date information for accurate diagrams
- üíæ Save diagram history for easy reference and iteration
